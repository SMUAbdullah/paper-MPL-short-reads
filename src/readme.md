This directory contains the codes required to run the MPL-R pipeline. The main file is `MPL-R.sh` which is used to call all other scripts. Before running, please ensure samtools 1.8, BWA, MAFFT, Python 3, and MATLAB are added to the path. Please also edit the file to specify the location of Quasirecomb and VarScan v2.3.9 before running. Once the code starts execution, the name of the current script being run is displayed in the terminal window. If run without parallel processing, the reconstruction step would take the most time.
